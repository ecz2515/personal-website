            I'm Evan Chen, a current junior studying CS & Violin at Northwestern University. I'm passionate about creating things, whether it's coding up a new project or performing chamber music with others. Currently, I enjoy being a TA at my university, leading technical workshops on AI ethics, and working in software engineering through internships and personal projects. I'm currently looking for SWE and data internships for Winter 2025 and beyond. Feel free to reach out!</p>
